# ðŸŽ… Obesity Analysis and Classification

## ðŸ“– What's inside?

This repo contains the notebook, data, and final report for my **analysis on the factors affecting obesity**. The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/raj-pulapakura/Obesity-Analysis-and-Classification/blob/master/Analysis%20of%20factors%20affecting%20Obesity.pdf).

## ðŸ¤” Why?

I created this repo for 2 main reasons:
1.  The final report included in this repo was an assignment for a Coursera project so I thought I might as well share it with the rest of the world.
2.  To showcase my Data Science skills, specifically Exploratory Data Analysis and experimentation with classification models.

## ðŸ¤— What can you do?

Feel free to read the report and gain a deeper understanding of the various factors affecting obesity rates, such as Gender, Age, Weight and Height.

I would really appreciate it if you could give me feedback on what I can improve in the report. To send me feedback, you can either create a new Issue in the repo, or email me at raj.pulapakura@gmail.com
